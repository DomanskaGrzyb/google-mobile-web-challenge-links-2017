**Session**: Tuesday, 07-11-2017 at 11am-1pm CET

**How many moderators from the course are in the channel busy answering questions?**
There are around 20 mentors monitoring the forum, and 3 to 4 admins in this slack channel. But you guys will be getting a full time community manager here soon as well .

**How students will be evaluated for nano degree program?**
We know from experience that teaching others is a great way of solidifying your learning; this is why we try to encourage as much interaction between all the scholarship participants as possible. One of Udacity’s values is BetterTogether and this applies to our community of students as well as internally. For measuring the interactions, we will be pulling data from the forums and the community managers of the program will be monitoring all activity here in the Slack channels. We want to see meaningful interactions, people helping each other out and why not create things together!  Quality of engagement is much more important than quantity here, and we will actually be looking out for spammers :wink:  Help each other out - you’ll go further together.

**I have downloaded the course videos - I don't always have time to study when I have reliable internet access... Is there somewhere that I can the teaching notes for each lesson offline, as I can only see them with the videos, and from what I can see the transcripts don't have them?**
As you mention, the videos can be downloaded for viewing whilst offline both on desktop and thorugh the Udacity mobile app. However, with the nature of the program being online you will have the best learning experience if you can access the Udacity classroom with a stable internet connection.

**Since social participation is so important for this course, I'd like to know what sorts of activities we should do in order to increase our chances for success. How exactly will we be graded on participation? What algorithms will be used to determine our level of engagement, and thus, our score?**

**My quiestion is, how actually involved is Google in this course? Is it in name only, are they sponsoring it, advertising it, or actually organising? Or maybe the course is mainly on Udacity?**
Thanks for the question Mosiur. Google is involved i different ways: first all of the course content was elaborated by Google engineers, so they are mostly responsible for the curriculum. When it comes to the student experience, everything is on our side (udacity) - but since Google is sponsoring the entire program, they are also a little involved in the community activities. They are a close partner and support us on things like making sure that you guys are happy, have the support and learning environment you need and get to the end. Their goal is for as many people as possible from this program to graduate, so let's show them how it's done :wink:

**Does someone who finishes course faster have better chance of entering the nanodegree program then others?**
No, this is not the case. It's not in anyone's best interest to rush through the content as fast as possible - this is not a productive way to learn. Of course, some people will be quicker than others but this is not an indicator of how the next batch for the Nanodegree places will be selected.

**What other Udacity course would you recommend to take in order to be better prepare for this challenge? For example, I feel very nervous about my JS level and I'm not super dextrous with the console.**
Very good question jess! I would definitely encourage all if you to check out the free catalogue of courses from Udacity as well - there are a lot of great resources there, and this can be a good way to consolidate very specific skills where you feel a little behind. One other thing that I would advise you to do is to have a look at the curriculum of the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree, to see what it would look like if you get selected for phase 2 and if there is anything you could do before to prep better! Good luck with everything :slightly_smiling_face: https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024

**Since the participating is a key aspect in the course, will there be any opportunity to form a meet up with not only course participators but also the moderators or even say udacity / google engineers too?**
There are no plans in the pipeline for offline meetups - this is an online scholarship program. However, the reason we create the communities here through slack are so that you can interact with the other students so if you would like to self-organise an unofficial study group then you're welcome to!

**Would Udacity mind that students got together on their own projects, using Udacity forums and Slack to communicate and ask questions?**
Yes, please do! We love it when our students collaborate to further their learning. As long as it doesn't hinder any other student's progress then we're all for it :thumbsup: 

**Assuming you have some metrics for this, what are the characteristics of the successful udacity student (not only in this course, but including other nanodegrees)?**
Without going into a ton of detail, key characteristics that we see are **grit, determination, and perseverance**. Learning any new skill can be equal parts rewarding and frustrating at the same time and it's very easy to give up. Blocking off time to frequently work on practicing the skills is so important - that's why we try to encourage students to return to the Udacity classroom at least a few times per week. Binge learning isn't really a good route to success unfortunately! We also see that peer support and community play a big impact hence why we set up these channels. Learning can be lonely but with the support of others (and thorugh helping others) everyone goes further.

**What If people interacts in other places too? like interacting on facebook groups, or in private slack channels? Will that be monitored?**
Private slack channels we cannot monitor. What you say in private slack messages cannot be seen or measured by us. That's why we have a code of conduct and we ask that everyone is respectful at all times to one another! _If anyone experiences any hostility of any kind from other students please report it to one of the admins immediately._
As for the facebook groups, this is not a primary channel that we will be monitoring. There will be some Udacity team members in there but the group exists for the benefit of the community, not for evaluation purposes.

**This is really a problem. No clear evaluation criteria. What if someone can learn only a small amount of time? How to be active and solve your and other problems if the course does not generate too many practical problems to solve.**
Hey Krzysztek thanks for the question. So we actually have a lot of very detailed data from the forums - but the most important thing is for you to go through all of the course content. Despite the amount of time you have, you would be surprised by how many people don't put that effort in! What we are trying to evaluate is not necessarily how good a student already is: we want to see how much they want to learn, how motivated they are, if they have the right mindset for this, and make sure they will stick it out if we select them for phase 2. I understand there may be some unclarity around this - but trust me that we put a lot of time and effort into the selection process, and it's not for nothing!

**Does the Initial 3 months challenge course only cover 10 Lessons?**
All the content for the initial phase is already accessible in your classroom - you have plenty of time to cover it so there is no need to rush through it. Instead, we encourage you to take advantage of this community - find study buddies, get involved in other projects, help those who are less advanced, etc. We will also be planning more activities for the rest of the 3 months, so stay tuned :slightly_smiling_face:

**Would we be receiving any form of recognition for completing the course? And if so, what weight does this recognition carry? Is this a recognised course, or is it just simply an online one?**
For the first part of the challenge course (initial 3 months) there is not a certificate provided. In the next phase, those who are selected for the full Nanodegree AND complete the Nanodegree will receive the Nanodegree program certificate which are recognised by Udacity's hiring partners.

**Can we upload our private projects on the forum for evaluation? Or just things related to the course?**
In general it is better to not spam the forum with things that are unrelated to the course or don't have any interest for other students. That said, it's also up to you to figure out what could or not be interesting! For example, if you were to start a project together with some of the students here, that was not part of the course, but inspired by what you have learned and using the skills that are taught in the course, that's awesome! But spamming other students with personal projects that are unrelated to the course, not so awesome :sweat_smile: I hope you understand what I mean!

**In case a student doesn't get one of those full nanodegree scholars, would s/he be able to try again?**
We only have a limited number of spaces available for the full Nanodegree programs in phase 2 of this scholarship program. Of course, any student is able to purchase the Nanodegree at any time but once the scholarship places have been allocated that's it.

**Hello,  I would like to ask,  will there be "over qualified"  candidates for scholarship?  Like someone with 4-5 years of hands-on experience**
There are no over experienced or under experienced students for us: only people who actually want to learn! This is really the goal of this: to give a full scholarship in phase 2 to the people who most deserve it - not in the sense that they are the best, but in the sense that they are hungry to learn, no matter how much they already know :slightly_smiling_face:

**Will there be any job recommendations after finishing the course (or nanodegree one)?**
For those selected for phase 2 with the full Nanodegree program, there is a comoplete suite of career support resources including CV reviews, GitHub profile reviews, LinkedIn profile help and more. We also have curated jobs with our various hiring partners. That said, we also see many jobs being recommended through the community - of course, our students and alumni have a much wider network than Udacity can have on it's own so we encourage everyone to share tips and career help with each other where they can.

**What does everybody think about maybe creating small teams (10-20 people) that could have their own channel? Hard to keep up with so many messages! Each team could help each other**
Hey John McLoughlin great question. As you know we currently are going through all the channel requests posted in #channels_requests . During the next days, we will be creating more channels, updating descriptions and setting up more live session - either about the program or for tutoring. Make sure that you keep an eye on the list of channels and use Slack appropriately: respond in threads, use the right channel, direct messages, etc. Once we have gone through this process, it will be much easier for you guys to feel like you belong to smaller groups here! And we can always improve by segmenting you guys further as we go - but we'll be the ones doing that :slightly_smiling_face:

**Perhaps I missed that information somewhere, but how often do we have an #ask_me_anything session live? Do we have set days? It will be good to know that as many here I think would like to take part even though they have full-time job.**
We will organise those sessions on a regular basis at the beginning of the program to make sure that everyone has the right info! They are not necessarily at the same time - in fact I will try to schedule them at different times of the day so that people with different schedules can follow them. Some students are also gathering the answers in a document that we will share with everyone on the forum and in this channel, which means you will be able to go back and read the answers to previous questions

Mark to answer your **question about numbers and how the program is structured**:
>**Phase 1: 60,000 Challenge Scholarships**
The first phase of this scholarship provides 3-months of access to one of four Udacity courses: Intro to HTML + CSS, Offline Web Applications, Android Basics and Developing Android Apps. Scholarship recipients in these courses will receive a robust community experience supported by dedicated Community Managers, Udacity mentor support, and a chance to qualify for a full Nanodegree scholarship.
**Phase 2: 6,000 Nanodegree Scholarships**
The top 6,000 students in the program earn an additional 6-month scholarship to one of four Nanodegree Programs: Front-End Web Developer, Mobile Web Specialist, Android Basics Nanodegree and Android Developer. The full-scholarships will include project reviews, mentorship and community support.

**If there are tasks within this course which require Android development, will there be a need to have a physical android device? Or can all of the tasks be done within an emulator?**
Having a phone or tablet is not required but having one available for testing purposes is useful if you have one to hand

**Would it be possible to have a  ama at a different time? I live in Italy and can't really read right now since I'm at work**
There will be future AMAs at different times, for sure. Keep an eye out for those announcements.
If you click on the pin at the top of the screen here in slack under the channel name you will see many of the answers are pinned to this channel. And finally, there is a. living document being with all the answers from this AMA session being curated here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlgUdd28p2_PDo27QIrYnlxCcmP9nyLAYs1boHOASBs/edit#heading=h.v69t1uxexij4

**I initially applied for the Front End Developer track (I stared web development in July) I sent an email to support and I was told about a week ago that my application will be reviewed, do you know when the students in this situation will get an answer? Thank you!**
As you can imagine we currently are working through a  huge flow of requests as this is the beginning of the course! While it's awesome to see how excited everyone is, it also means that due to the huge volume of communications, we are a bit slower than usual in treating those requests. We can estimate that, by the end of next week, everyone who asked about this kidn of things should hear back but we need you to be a little patient. We've made notes of everything and are investigating one case at a time! And don't worry, you will still have plenty of time to complete everything and enjoy yourself before the first phase is over.

**When will the "winners" of the Nanodegree be announced?**
The deadline for Phase 1 is February 6 - after this we will take around one week to go through everything and select the top 6,000 students for all tracks. We will let you know via email whether or not you have been selected around the 12th of February APPROXIMATELY. We will let you know about the specific date as soon as we can.
