## AMA Session #2  

**Date**: Tuesday, 07-11-2017 at 8pm-10pm CET <br>
**Mentors**: Chaitra and Stuart

#### Knowledge gained with this scholarship is enough to apply for Mobile web specialist certification?
The Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree will get you ready to take Google's Mobile Web Specialist certification. So if you do both Phases of this scholarship program, you'll be well prepared. This first Phase, with the scholarship challenge course will help you get started, but won't cover all the topics tested by the Google certification.

#### Hi, I have almost no experiance in web coding. Where can I find a list of all I need to learn for the course?
The Mobile Web Specialist program assumes you have some experience with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript and you were admitted into this program based on your application which indicated your experience levels with those. If you have no experience, you could take Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS as well as our Intro to JavaScript.

#### Hi, i still cannot access the course, what is the timeline on fixing that?
Umut We are working diligently to make sure everything is all set up for you as soon as possible. We expect to have your access restored within the next few days, at which point you will see the scholarship course in your Udacity classroom (https://classroom.udacity.com/). so feel free to check there for updates in the interim. Thanks for your patience as we work to resolve this.

#### What advise do you give to us with limited learning hours ie, because of work, Vacation etc.. could this impact our chance to get through to the next stage? completeing the course shouldnt be a problem but community input may be impacted.
Antony K Since you have 3-months to complete the course, our advice is to carve out intentional time that works best for your schedule to work on the course, engage with the peer and mentor community and work to help one another in the program. The quality of your interactions and support in the the program is really important so if you have limited time, that's okay. Just make sure to build in the time and hold yourself accountable to using it well.

#### Hey and thanks for being here! I have been going through the lessons today ( up to lesson 3 - 11 atm) and i have noticed I haven't uploaded any "solutions" yet. Will there be in the future a time where we will so you guys can evaluate or progress? Thanks!
George F. We will look at your progress in the course, answers to the quizzes along the way, as well your your contributions to the forums and slack community. We will not be evaluating projects during the Scholarship Challenge; that will come if you qualify for the full Nanodegree scholarship.

#### Will activity in external sources, such as being active in git repositories count as participation?
Good question Lukas! We will reference a lot of the information you provided in your original application, including but not limited to, Github profiles, projects, and your essays. So yes, we will look at that if you included sufficient info in your original application.

#### Where we can find a list with all mentors and Udacity peoples/moderators?
Good suggestion! We don't currently have a static list for you. But you can always get help by posting on the forums. Or here in Slack, ping the #livehelp channel (or just ping me, Chaitra, or anaisbrg )

#### Will help provided in the country-specific channels be taken into account towards community contribution?
We will be looking across all available channels (here and in the forums) for that data.

#### How stressfull is so much input for the moderators and admins? I could not deal with that.
Thank you for thinking of us Niklas Merz! While it is a lot of input, we are grateful for the opportunity to work with so many awesome developers!

#### How would you describe the perfect candidate for the nanodegree program?
Some of Udacity’s values are BetterTogether and AudaciousandHumble and this applies to our community of students as well as internally. In our experience, the most successful Nanodegree students are students who go above and beyond not just for themselves in pushing their learning process but in also supporting their peers in getting to the finish line. What this looks like in practice is students who are active and engaged in the online communities, stepping up to volunteer information to their peers, create opportunities they see that could be useful for the whole group, etc. We are constantly working to improve the student experience and often time it's our students themselves who provide the best solutions! :slightly_smiling_face:

#### Are you also going to consider the "financial need" element for the determination? Not to sound offensive or anything, but I see that some people are already established, working developers. Also purchasing power is not similar across participating countries.
Great question Umut and not offensive at all. We will not ask for any financial information from you. We will however, evaluate your essay responses from your original application for any particular need this scholarship may help address for you.

#### Hi. How long we will be able to access slack channels, forums after the scholarship has finished?
You will have access to the slack channels and forums for a month after the 3-month phase 1 is over. Please bear in mind that though you will have access, these platforms won't be moderated.

#### we who dosn't have a lot a experience, who not worked before, dosnt have an disavantage?
Dragos Busuioc, that is one of the very reasons we look at community participation as well as your performance in classroom.udacity.com. As long as you're working hard, asking questions, and helping others, you have a really good chance. Even if you're less experienced.

#### Do we need to use a NodeJS server to get Service Workers work? Or could it work with an Apache server? Do we need to use AngularJS or can we just use JS?
This is a perfect question for #livehelp (or the forums in classroom.udacity.com) where technical mentors can help you.

#### Hello there, i'm glad to join this programs which is the best way to learning and to be effective in this challenge ?
We are so glad you are here! The single biggest recommendation I would have is to plan for and create intentional space for your learning that will fit best with your schedule and life. 
Students who are most successful share with us that they make consistent progress in our programs by setting specific and measurable goals that they can hold themselves accountable for and the key is to make this a routine for themselves. Though this may not be technical preparation for a program, this is key to success in an online learning environment. 
I hope this helps!

#### So you hadn't checked the essay responses for the initial selection, or you meant you'll be checking them again?
We will be checking them again luisadn

#### What is the difference between forums and channels here on slack to make the benefit of this great community?
fouad ashraf, due to the size of this community, only admins can post to #general . Think of forums as a great place to ask technical questions, especially about or related to the courses. You can also ask technical questions here, especially in #livehelp . Slack channels can provide more areas to build community (for example around group projects, or a common language, or framework).

#### What is the level of "participation" from Udacity and Google towards the material presented on these courses ?
That's what we are here for and you will be seeing even more support in the coming week from Community Managers! In terms of participation, what we are really looking for is students creating a productive and supportive learning environment for one another and sharing the knowledge they are learning from the classroom with the group. This can take effect in lots of different ways: peer-to-peer support on slack and/or forums, students taking on informal mentor roles to share their learning, collaboration in small groups, etc.

#### Is this the first scholarship? Or is this a recurring one?
This is the first scholarship for this program and the second one offered in the region

#### Can we add our github profile later on? I didn't have a github at the time of application.
Umut, while you cannot update your application, you can share your Github repos or particular projects you want to make sure we (and your classmates) see on the forums. Be sure to ask for actionable feedback.

#### Slack channels that are considered and evaluated as a contribution to the community are just those moderated by Udacity mentors or even for example #italian and so on?
Pamela Fracassa Ciao Pamela! We will be doing our best to evaluate all the channels. Just make sure to sync up with anaisbrg to ensure the your country channel is public :slightly_smiling_face:

#### I want to know what is the difference of content between this three months of google scholarship and the mobile web specialist nanodegree of udacity?
This first 3 month scholarship covers a portion of the content included in the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree (but only a portion). So by making progress on this challenge course, you will have made progress on the Nanodegree as well. Your progress will carry over. fouad ashraf

#### are we have to join these course every day or can we join when we avaible ?
You can study at your own pace. We recognize that everyone has different schedules and have built our courses so you can learn when you have time, but are not at a disadvantage if you can't study everyday!

#### What information can we share with the world about the scholarship? Are there any restrictions? Like in, can we write about it, how cool the lessons are, etc.?
You can share any information about these scholarships that you'd like. Our scholarship students often write about their experiences and we love to see it! So do the instructors from Google!

#### Hi All. On the course page there are estimated times needed to complete the individual lessons. Do they include the time needed to complete the exercises or do they only cover time for watching the videos? I'm wondering how much time do I need weekly to complete this course on time. Thanks!
The time estimates are our best estimate for watching the videos and completing the exercises. That said, every student consumes content at a different pace so pls take this into account when building in time in your schedule. Once you complete a few of the lessons, you'll be able to best gauge how these times compare to your own pace

#### I'm pretty sure my question is not related to this schoolarship, but I'm just being curious. Are Google developers forced to use Google Products? I've seen in the past some Microsoft Developers using Internet Explorer in some of their Web Developing courses which was hilarious.
I really don't know the answer to that and can't speak for Googlers (I work for Udacity). But I bet many of them like using Google products, which is why they wanted to work there.

#### Can you recommend any way of contributing that isn't as time-sensitive as bug squashing, or will the community interaction be weighted less than the actual quality of the projects submitted ?
We completely understand that many of you have full-time work, school and life commitments and appreciate that this scholarship program will fit into your other responsibilities. In terms of community interaction, we encourage you to contribute when you can and works for your schedule. It's more about the quality of your contributions and engagement than quantity.

#### I don't have the full pre-reqs for the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree. Should I ask to switch to Front End?
Good question! We intended for our pre-reqs to be guideposts. Not everyone will have all of them. And you may need to do some learning on the side, but based on your application, we felt like this program would be the best challenge for you. If you have *no* web dev experience and find the material too difficult, please do let us know.

#### Are you full-time hired to spend time on Slack? That sounds like a cool job.
I do have a cool job em! I head up our scholarships team at Udacity (check out all our scholarship programs at udacity.com/scholarships). So I don't spend all my time on Slack, but we do have full time community managers (like anaisbrg ) and program managers (like Chaitra) and they have awesome jobs too!

#### Do you plan any other scholarship for europe ? I think I saw something about data.
We will be updating our scholarships page (udacity.com/scholarships) with all new offering so definitely check the site for any updates and fill out the information requested under the “notify me” section so you receive emails when new programs become available

#### Are we earning a pretty Badge at least if we don't succeed to the second phase? It's a good 3 months course full of insight and we might want to show it off in our LinkedIn without sounding like we failed to get into the Nano-degree.
We will follow up at the end of the Scholarship Challenge with instructions on how to show off your participation (and selection) on LinkedIn Sabina

#### The forum is 'Oops! That page doesn't exist or is private.', how long will it take to fix this ?
This is a super important question from Enas. If you are seeing that error message, it means you need to first access the forums from inside the classroom. Do do that;
1) Go to the course: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud899-emea
2) Go into one of the lessons (like this one: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud899-emea/lessons/d20f0f14-11ed-49e9-9ef4-56d7650c36d4/concepts/cecdb157-5ce7-4c76-897c-fb964f8092f2) 
3) Click on the "Resources" icon in the left hand menu. 
4) Access forums through there
You need to access the forum through the classroom the first time to get appropriate permissions.

#### The offline web apps course is a bit old and the tools used on canary looks a bit different than the latest one, so is it possible to make a note under the course videos maybe with a screenshot of the new version? It would be great because it's confusing people new to chrome dev tools
Thanks for this feedback hadi and Nathan March . We will pass it along to the instructors. While we make every effort to keep all materials up to date, we recognize how quickly technology changes and appreciate your diligence in managing those discrepancies in the interim.
